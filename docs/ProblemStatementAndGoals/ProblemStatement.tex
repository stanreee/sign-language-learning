\subsection{Problem}

Learning a new language can be an arduous task, one that only gets harder as people grow older in life. Time becomes a more scarce resource as individuals may find it difficult to make the effort to learn. ASLingo aims to ease that burden by providing an online, easy-to-access web application that allows individuals to test their understanding as well as learn new signs at their own pace in a fun, interactive manner. This application will be able to provide live feedback as the user learns and attempts new signs.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

The input of ASLingo or the system should be the hand gestures known as signs, at which point the system should be able to determine whether the system is correct or incorrect. The flow from input to output should work as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The user would attempt to form the sign of what the system prompted them to do
    \item The system would process and determine whether or not the user formed the correct sign
    \item The system would output an according response based on whether or not the user was correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

The stakeholders for this project would include the hard of hearing community as well as individuals who wish to learn ASL. This would naturally expand outward towards educators who wish to promote the learning of ASL to their respective institutions.

\subsection{Environment}

The software of ASLingo is a computer web-browser with live translation capabilities. The software can identify hand signs from a live video feed.

\wss{Hardware and software}

\section{Goals}

Ease Of Access:\\
Individuals with access to the Internet should be able to use ASLingo anytime, anywhere. The user's ability to access the system should not be inhibited by anything within the design.

~\\Accessibility:\\
The system should be simple and intuitive to use with little to none required thought from the user to begin the training. Anyone of learning age should be able to utilize ASLingo to learn a few hand signs. 

~\\Engaging\\
A crucial part of the learning experience is keeping the student's attention. ASLingo should be engaging, and thereby fun, enough such that the user is willing to engage with the system independent of external influences.

~\\User Customize Experience\\
A user should be able to focus their learning experience if they wish to learn specific phrases rather than just general signing. The option to specialize what they learn should prove to enrich their experience while using the software.

\section{Stretch Goals}

Mobile Port:\\
Eventually port the web application to a phone application to increase ease-of-access and usability. Having a dedicated mobile experience would naturally improve the Ease of Access and accessibility as accessing web services on mobile is notorious for poor user-end experience.

~\\Expansion to Other Sign Languages\\
ASL is not the only sign language in the world, and since sign language has yet to universally standardized, the integration of different types of sign languages unique to their country of origin would allow for ASLingo to be taken worldwide.
