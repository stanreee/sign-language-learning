\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

One significant risk we have identified pertains to the accuracy and reliability of the computer vision aspect of this application. As this is the
primary functionality for this application, it is necessary that our system should demonstrate the capability to detect and recognize complex
hand signs and motions. One way we could validate our ability to mitigate this risk would be to prove that we can build a 
system that can accurately recognize all the letters of the American Sign Language alphabet.\\
Another risk relates to ensuring that the system can provide realtime feedback based on the user's hand sign inputs with
an acceptable time delay. As this will be a web application, we suspect that much of the computer vision computation will be on the 
server/backend side. This may introduce uncertainty in creating a realtime feedback system, particularly since computer vision is more computationally
intensive compared to text recognition based applications like Duolingo. For our proof of concept, we will deploy our computer vision model
onto a server, and test the delay in the server's response when it receives a request to recognize a hand sign from another device.
