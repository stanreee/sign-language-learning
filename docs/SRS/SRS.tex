This document describes the requirements for ASLingo. The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template \textit{Robertson And Robertson (2012)}.  Subsections \textit{Clients} and \textit{Customers} were removed due to not having any such dependents.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

Learning a new language can be an arduous task that only gets more challenging
with age, as individuals may find it difficult to dedicate time and effort to
it. American Sign Language (ASL) is particularly hard due to its visual and
gestural nature, which is not found in other, verbal languages. The purpose of this project is
to ease that challenge by providing an online, easy-to-access web platform for
individuals to learn new signs and test their comprehension at their own pace
in a fun, interactive manner. Focusing in on consistent effort and continuous
feedback, ASLingo provides real-time guidance to ensure users stay on track to
achieving their goals of learning ASL.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

 The stakeholders for this project include those who use sign language as their primary mode of communication in daily life as well as those who have an interest in learning ASL, as one of the main objectives of this project is to help people to learn ASL easier. This would naturally expand outward towards secondary users of this application which may be educators who wish to promote the learning of ASL to their respective institutions. The objectives of the stakeholders for this project should be the ability to learn ASL more effectively as they will not only be able to recognize what signs mean, but will be able to practice signing themselves to better their understanding. This therefore should also be an application that is able to be used for both individuals who cannot hear and those who can, as we want to further the understanding of ASL for a wide variety of users with varying differences in abilities.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The project is constrained by the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{\textit{The Project Expenses Cannot Exceed \$750}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The project cannot be bought or be a `ready-made' solution, and any cost incurred must be minimized to ensure cost-efficiency.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{\textit{Test Only a Subset of the Most Commonly Used Phrases of ASL}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The project in the long-term would encompass the entirety of ASL as a whole. But with the given time-constraints, the testable language subset will be limited.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{\textit{The Project Must be Finished by the End of the Academic Year}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is the hard deadline for the project and sets the time constraint that is used to judge the scope of work the project can encompass.
    \end{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{\textit{Users Should Only Learn from the Provided "On Rails" Approach}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Users are only able to learn from the preset programs the project has. The education provided should be taught in a manner with little room misinterpretation. While we attempt to make the learning content as broad as possible, users lack true learning freedom to learn what they want.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The user will always have the camera facing their hands when using the application.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Correct camera angling towards the user's hands is the first condition for the application to work.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The environmental lighting will always be sufficient for joint detection.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] Proper lighting is the second condition for the application to work since it cannot properly distinct what the user signs without it.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The user's signs will be within reasonable form of the proper sign, enough to be recognized by the system.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] If the user signs are correct but with poor form, the system will have a hard time determining if it is correct.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The user's camera will have the necessary technical requirements to accurately capture the signs displayed by the user.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[] The user's camera should have the capability of viewing the input of the user, with ample resolution and frame rate.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
There are currently no open issues with the project at the moment.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The ASL App is a mobile exclusive platform with 2,500+ signs and phrases to teach ASL via short video clips. This app offers 4 packs for free with the basics like the alphabet, numbers, and universal gestures. Paid packs are also available ex. compliments, moods, and social gestures for \$0.99. The app ultimately serves as a mobile hub for common expressions to study and learn wherever you are.
    \item Canadian Hearing Services offer both in-person and virtual educational ASL courses for a variety of experience levels. These courses educate via teacher instruction, role play, videos, and work books. A variety of other public, private, and educational institutes offer similar courses and instructional content.
    \item Duolingo is a popular mobile application that provides language courses for many languages from across the world, with 50+ million monthly active users. The app utilizes gamification to encourage consistent user progress and interest. Majority of the courses are based on testing users on vocabulary and grammar via reading, listening, and speaking problems which increase in difficulty as users progress. Its courses are well developed through research and accord with global language standards, such as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{New Problems}
There are currently no new problems.

\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development should follow the agile methodology, with emphasis on different aspects of the project: front-end, back-end, and computer vision.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
Not applicable for our project.

\subsection{Risks}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The primary risk of this product is the potential for error when trying to analyze and recognize a user's sign to give feedback or determine if their form is correct. This could cause users to improperly learn signs and hinder their learning.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Costs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Website domain - TBA
    \item App hosting platform - TBA
    \item Database - TBA
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
The system and its interface should be intuitive enough to learn how to use the app. User documentation to be supplied with the product should include a general setup guide and can include a glossary for basic signs, such as for the alphabet.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system should incorporate full body signs (eg. the sign for "shorts") and facial expression/body language recognition, as they are a crucial aspect of sign language.
    \item The system should provide different courses for learners of varying skill level.
    \item The system should teach other common sign languages.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Appendix --- Reflection}

%The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
%graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
%  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
%  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
%  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
%  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
%  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
%  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
%  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
%  least one item for each team member.
%  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
%  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
%  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
%  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Many software design and principles courses contribute to the team's success on the capstone project. Our project is primarily software-based, involving a combination of everything taught throughout the program, including software design, development, and documentation. Here is a list of specific courses that were particularly helpful for us: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item SFWRENG 2AA4
        \item SFWRENG 2C03
        \item SFWRENG 2XA3
        \item SFWRENG 2XB3
        \item SFWRENG 3A04
        \item SFWRENG 3RA3
        \item SFWRENG 3S03
        \item SFWRENG 3XA3
        \item SFWRENG 4HC3
    \end{itemize}
    \item Some overall knowledge and skills that will be required in the entire team include domain knowledge (the fundamentals of ASL and basic signing), skills in technical tools for development (React, OpenCV, Python, etc.), documentation writing skills, and communication skills for connecting with stakeholders.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Edward -- On the technical side, I will need to familiarize myself with OpenCV and computer vision in general. As well, I will need to learn how to apply machine learning to recognizing specific hand motions. On the non-technical side, I will need to familiarize myself with ASL and at minimum learn basic hand signs. I aim to learn more than just the fundamentals, so I can help to design the course that our project provides.
	    \item Cassidy -- For technical skills, I am mostly familiar with back end development, so through this project I hope to learn more about front end web development, as well as learning some fundamentals of machine learning for the hand motions. I also hope to be able to learn some ASL through this project, as well as further develop project development and time management skills.
        \item Stanley -- As I would like to familiarize myself with computer vision, I will also need to focus on some back-end fundamentals as well. Although I'll be focusing mainly on the front-end, since our computer vision component will work hand and hand with the back-end of ASLingo, I'll naturally need to be able to know both at a basic level. For non-technical skills, I'd like to gain more experience in communicating with stakeholders on a more project management level.
        \item Jeremy -- With a focus on the full stack development role within the team I will have to become comfortable with modern full stack development technologies and practises. Such practises will include creating a responsive front end that allows for an intuitive user experience, creating a back end ecosystem to store our data, and integrating the OpenCV and ML aspects. I also look forward to using github CI/CD and ensuring good code coverage testing and smooth deployments for future changes.
        \item Andrew -- I aim to bring my industry experience in the field of system verification and translate that over to this project.  I'll mainly be focusing on ensuring correctness within the python-OPenCV back-end by writing units tests to ensure complete code coverage.  Naturally this will require me to understand OpenCV enough to test for edge cases and more niche scenarios in which we do not intend for the project to be used while working in lock-step with the rest of the team. I hope to additionally polish up on my communications and UI design skills to bring forward a design that will satisfy the stakeholders and make the use of our final product as smooth as possible.
    \end{itemize}
    \item All team members are making it a personal goal to attend as many McMaster Sign Language Club meetings as possible to learn basic signs and gestures, as well as interact with some of our stakeholders. To learn full stack development we will be following tutorials and best practises from the industry standards such as Mozilla MDN Web Docs, documentation from our framework and language of choice,and articles posted on FreeCodeCamp, GeeksForGeeks, Medium etc. Learning OpenCV and AI/ML topics will also be learned via a similar method.
