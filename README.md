Date of project start: September 18th, 2023

Learning a new language can be an arduous task that only gets more challenging
with age, as individuals may find it difficult to dedicate time and effort to
it. American Sign Language (ASL) is particularly hard due to its visual and
gestural nature, which is not found in other, verbal languages. ASLingo aims
to ease that challenge by providing an online, easy-to-access web platform for
individuals to learn new signs and test their comprehension at their own pace
in a fun, interactive manner. With a focus on consistent effort and continuous
feedback, ASLingo provides real-time guidance to ensure users stay on track to
achieving their goals of learning ASL.

This project allows people to learn and test their knowledge of ASL using a 
computer-vision aspect built into a web browser, so people can practice signing 
and ensure that their form is correct. The online learning platform will recognize 
the sign the user has displayed and will determine if they have done the prompted 
sign correctly, or if they need to learn more and try again. This is a great tool for 
those who are new to ASL or just want to practice!
