\section{Introduction}

Decomposing a system into modules is a commonly accepted approach to developing
software.  A module is a work assignment for a programmer or programming
team~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}.  We advocate a decomposition
based on the principle of information hiding~\citep{Parnas1972a}.  This
principle supports design for change, because the ``secrets'' that each module
hides represent likely future changes.  Design for change is valuable in SC,
where modifications are frequent, especially during initial development as the
solution space is explored.  

Our design follows the rules layed out by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}, as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item System details that are likely to change independently should be the
  secrets of separate modules.
\item Each data structure is implemented in only one module.
\item Any other program that requires information stored in a module's data
  structures must obtain it by calling access programs belonging to that module.
\end{itemize}

After completing the first stage of the design, the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS), the Module Guide (MG) is developed~\citep{ParnasEtAl1984}. The MG
specifies the modular structure of the system and is intended to allow both
designers and maintainers to easily identify the parts of the software.  The
potential readers of this document are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item New project members: This document can be a guide for a new project member
  to easily understand the overall structure and quickly find the
  relevant modules they are searching for.
\item Maintainers: The hierarchical structure of the module guide improves the
  maintainers' understanding when they need to make changes to the system. It is
  important for a maintainer to update the relevant sections of the document
  after changes have been made.
\item Designers: Once the module guide has been written, it can be used to
  check for consistency, feasibility, and flexibility. Designers can verify the
  system in various ways, such as consistency among modules, feasibility of the
  decomposition, and flexibility of the design.
\end{itemize}

The rest of the document is organized as follows. Section
\ref{SecChange} lists the anticipated and unlikely changes of the software
requirements. Section \ref{SecMH} summarizes the module decomposition that
was constructed according to the likely changes. Section \ref{SecConnection}
specifies the connections between the software requirements and the
modules. Section \ref{SecMD} gives a detailed description of the
modules. Section \ref{SecTM} includes two traceability matrices. One checks
the completeness of the design against the requirements provided in the SRS. The
other shows the relation between anticipated changes and the modules. Section
\ref{SecUse} describes the use relation between modules.

\section{Anticipated and Unlikely Changes} \label{SecChange}

This section lists possible changes to the system. According to the likeliness
of the change, the possible changes are classified into two
categories. Anticipated changes are listed in Section \ref{SecAchange}, and
unlikely changes are listed in Section \ref{SecUchange}.

\subsection{Anticipated Changes} \label{SecAchange}

Anticipated changes are the source of the information that is to be hidden
inside the modules. Ideally, changing one of the anticipated changes will only
require changing the one module that hides the associated decision. The approach
adapted here is called design for
change.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acInfo}:] The ASL vocabulary included in the program may be updated in the future as the language evolves.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAbout}:] The Landing Page Module may change if the developers want to change the formatting of the informational pages on the website (for example the home/resources page that use this module). 
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acExercise}:] Exercise and Exercise Selection/History module may change if developers want to add in additional testing methods or material.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acAccount}:] Account management module may change if developers change what information is stored about the users progress. 
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acMLModel}:] Structure of neural network in Machine Learning module may change to improve performance and accuracy.
\item[\refstepcounter{acnum} \actheacnum \label{acTestVerif}:] Test cases in the Testing and Verification module may change throughout development to improve code coverage as well as to cover any previously mentioned anticipated changes.
\end{description}

\subsection{Unlikely Changes} \label{SecUchange}

The module design should be as general as possible. However, a general system is
more complex. Sometimes this complexity is not necessary. Fixing some design
decisions at the system architecture stage can simplify the software design. If
these decision should later need to be changed, then many parts of the design
will potentially need to be modified. Hence, it is not intended that these
decisions will be changed.

\begin{description}
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucIO}:] Input/Output devices
  (Input: File and/or Keyboard, Output: File, Memory, and/or Screen).
\item[\refstepcounter{ucnum} \uctheucnum \label{ucLogin}:] The Authentication module is unlikely to change as we will be using user authentication methods and standard login procedures that are unlikely to change.
\end{description}

\section{Module Hierarchy} \label{SecMH}

This section provides an overview of the module design. Modules are summarized
in a hierarchy decomposed by secrets in Table \ref{TblMH}. The modules listed
below, which are leaves in the hierarchy tree, are the modules that will
actually be implemented.

\section{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

The design of the system is intended to satisfy the requirements developed in
the SRS. In this stage, the system is decomposed into modules. The connection
between requirements and modules is listed in Table~\ref{TblRT}.

\section{Module Decomposition} \label{SecMD}

Modules are decomposed according to the principle of ``information hiding''
proposed by \citet{ParnasEtAl1984}. The \emph{Secrets} field in a module
decomposition is a brief statement of the design decision hidden by the
module. The \emph{Services} field specifies \emph{what} the module will do
without documenting \emph{how} to do it. For each module, a suggestion for the
implementing software is given under the \emph{Implemented By} title. If the
entry is \emph{OS}, this means that the module is provided by the operating
system or by standard programming language libraries.  \emph{\progname{}} means the
module will be implemented by the \progname{} software.

Only the leaf modules in the hierarchy have to be implemented. If a dash
(\emph{--}) is shown, this means that the module is not a leaf and will not have
to be implemented.

\section{Traceability Matrix} \label{SecTM}

This section shows two traceability matrices: between the modules and the
requirements and between the modules and the anticipated changes. 

In Table~\ref{TblACT}, the anticipated change \acref{acInfo} maps to multiple modules in our system. This change refers to the fact that ASL just like
many other languages is always evolving and changing over time. Because of this, if this system were to update the words or phrases that are used in
this application, it would affect the hand recognition models that were built on older data, as well as all the other modules that are affected by this model change.

\section{Use Hierarchy Between Modules} \label{SecUse}

In this section, the uses hierarchy between modules is
provided. \citet{Parnas1978} said of two programs A and B that A {\em uses} B if
correct execution of B may be necessary for A to complete the task described in
its specification. That is, A {\em uses} B if there exist situations in which
the correct functioning of A depends upon the availability of a correct
implementation of B.  Figure \ref{FigUH} illustrates the use relation between
the modules. It can be seen that the graph is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Each level of the hierarchy offers a testable and usable subset of the
system, and modules in the higher level of the hierarchy are essentially simpler
because they use modules from the lower levels.

\section{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Problem Analysis and Design.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the limitations of your solution?  Put another way, given
  unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)\\
  There are a few improvements we could implement given more time and resources. One of the main limitations of our design is that we
  do not have separate modules for dealing with static and dynamic hand signs. A perfect solution would recognize the expected type of
  hand sign and deal with the corresponding type individually. Static and dynamic hand signs are dealt with differently as for static signs,
  individual frames are what the machine learning model looks at, and for dynamic signs, the model should look at groupings of frames.\\
  Another limitation of our design is having one single controller module to connect the frontend with the backend. While this simplifies our
  work in design, given unlimited time, it would be ideal to have data sent through multiple controller modules, wherever a frontend/backend
  connection needs to be facilitated.
  \item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered.  What
  are the benefits and tradeoffs of those other designs compared with the chosen
  design?  From all the potential options, why did you select documented design?
  (LO\_Explores)\\
  One particular design solution we had in mind for the transfer of webcam frame data from the frontend to the backend was to
  only read the user's hand signs after a specified countdown timer, where the system would then send the current frame to the
  backend. This would avoid the need of sending each frame to the backend, improving performance. Although this would work with
  static hand signs (most letters of the alphabet), dynamic hand signs which involve the movement of hands to be tracked, would fail
  to be recognized. As such, we decided to continue with the original plan of sending each frame to the backend, and dealing with
  any potential performance issues during implementation.\\
  We also initially assumed that the middleman module between the frontend and the backend would only use the frontend and backend modules,
  and not vice versa where the frontend/backend modules would use the controller module. This was not the case, as we ran into
  scenarios where the hand sign verification module and the exercise module would require the use of certain functions in the controller
  module.
