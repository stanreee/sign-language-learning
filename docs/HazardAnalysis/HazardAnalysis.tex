\section{Introduction}
This document aims to outline and analyze the potential hazards of ASLingo. A hazard can be defined as a system state or set of conditions, often arising from inherent risks or software anomalies, that, when coupled with particular worst-case environmental conditions or unexpected interactions, can lead to a loss or adverse outcomes. This embodies potential sources of harm due to software failures, bugs, or undesired system behavior, emphasizing proactive identification and mitigation to ensure software safety and functionality.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
Hazard analysis is a fundamental aspect of the software development process, crucial for preventing losses or adverse outcomes that are undesirable for any product. It involves identifying areas where hazards may arise and determining steps to either reduce or eliminate their effects, making it an important part of the development journey. This analysis is closely tied to the safety and security requirements of the software. Ensuring these requirements are well met significantly contributes to enhancing the software's reliability, making it a more dependable product in the long run.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
ASLingo's system will involve the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A camera to allow for user input
    \item A web frontend to provide user interface and authenticate user login
    \item A backend to process software logic
    \item A machine learning model to interpret user hand signs
\end{enumerate}

The system boundaries of ASLingo include our web application with the user's camera input, our machine learning model which is trained to learn hand signs, and our back and front end systems that will allow our model to interact with the user's inputs. Due to the limitations of these parts of our system, these may cause hazards to occur or cause our system to not function as intended, so these components of our system will be explored further in this document. 

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assume users are using ASLingo for its intended purpose
    \item Assume users are able and willing to follow safety instructions
\end{enumerate}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\subsection{Web Application Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=WAR\arabic*.]
    \item{The system shall send a reset link to a user credientals for a registered email which will reset and allow the user to create a new password}
    \item{The system shall create a daily backup of stored data that will be recreated daily to backup any lost data}
    \item{The system shall notify users of any expected downtimes for upgrades and be locked out of account until complete}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=HR\arabic*.]
    \item{The system shall inform the user that the camera requires better lighting in their environment if there not enough currently}
    \item{The system shall inform the user that the camera is inoperable}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Computer Vision Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=CVR\arabic*.]
    \item{The model will be trained on multiple sign language data sets from varying sources and characteristics}
    \item{The system will notify the user if it is unable to detect signs due to motions being too fast or slow}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Roadmap}

After careful consideration and reassessment, we see that there are many new requirements for us to take into consideration that weren't initially apparent when writing the Software Requirement Specification. Ideally, we will aim to implement every safety requirement, but realistically when taking into account time constraints, those requirements that are strictly necessary for system functionality may be the only ones that get implemented. Primarily, we will be focusing in on the WA and CV requirements, with a majority of the effort being channeled into the CV requirements since that is the main basis that will be providing the functionality for sign recognition. The hazard analysis will be used as a reference throughout the development process and may be amended when necessary in the future.
