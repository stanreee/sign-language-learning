\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

 Hand sign tracking & Hand sign motions are too fast/slow & System cannot accurately give user feedback and measure progress & Model and system efficiency & Interrupt the user and inform user to adjust hand sign motions accordingly & TODO & TODO \\
\hline
Camera & Visual feed is unable to be captured & User's sign cannot be perceived by the device and subsequently be processed & 1. Poor Lighting Conditions & 1. Instruct user to adjust their environment lighting or move to environment with sufficient lighting & HR1 & H3-1 \\
  &  &  & 2. User skin color is not within the bounds of the training set data used & 2. Broaden training dataset to include more skin color types & DTR1 & H3-2 \\
  & Physical defect that impairs operation &  & 3. Cracked/Filthy camera lenses & 3. Notify user that camera lenses appear to be inoperable & HR2 & H4-1 \\
