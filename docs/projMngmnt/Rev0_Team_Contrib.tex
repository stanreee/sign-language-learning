\section{Demo Plans}

We plan on starting the demo with a quick introduction using sign language. We willl then walk through the front page UI, going through the 3 key pages:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The hand sign resources page
    \item The hand sign practice page
    \item The exercise page
\end{enumerate}
Afterwards, we will leave time for questions with the Professor and TA.

\section{Meeting Attendance}

% \wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended since the
% POC demo.  This number should be determined from the meeting issues in the
% team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of team
% meetings held by the team.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 22\\
Cassidy Bladin & 4\\
Stanley Chan & 6\\
Andrew Kil & 6\\
Jeremy Langner & 4\\
Edward Zhuang & 4\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Back-end Team held meetings on our own that Jeremy and Cassidy did not have to attend. Edward had work obligations that led him to miss a couple team meetings.

\section{Lecture Attendance}

\section{Commits}

We unfortunately haven't making use of Git issue tracking as much as we should. Any issue has been communicated using our internal Discord and resolved through said Discord.

\section{CICD}

CICD is used in our project all the time. As stated in our Development plan, we open new branches for development features continuously committing to them until the feature is complete. Afterwards, we merge the branch to main and integrate the feature.
