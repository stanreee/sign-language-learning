        <p>
          All you need to get started is a web browser and a webcam! 
          You will first learn some basic signs by watching a teacher from
          the Deaf community, then the application will prompt you with a 
          question on what you have learned. You can then sign the correct
          ASL sign to match the prompt, and the application will tell you if 
          you got it right! You can use this application to practice ASL and
          learn how to properly sign from our expert teachers.
