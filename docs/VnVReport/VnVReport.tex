\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

As a machine learning-based image recognition web app, ASLingo has many areas to be tested. The overall software will be broken down into modules. There will be a front-end, a back-end, a database, and a machine learning model which all need to be separately tested, along with physical hardware and compatibility. This document serves as a report of the testing done to ensure that this system has been properly and thoroughly tested to meet the requirements set by the \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements Specification}.  

\subsection{Objectives}

This document aims to outline the testing plan for ASLingo in order to create a functional and reliable product for users that aligns with the specified requirements. The team seeks to build confidence in stakeholders and users that the software is correct and meets or exceeds the initial intended goals, resulting in an overall satisfactory user experience.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation} 

Below is a list of the relevant documentation referenced within the Verification and Validation Plan.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/DevelopmentPlan/DevelopmentPlan.pdf}{Development Plan} outlines the roles of each team member and the areas that each member will focus on. This breakdown of team responsibilities allows the team to assign testing roles accordingly. This document also contains the tools that the team plans on using for testing.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/VnVPlan/VnVPlan.pdf}{VnV Plan} outlines the testing plan for the system, as well as outlining the test cases that the team will perform to ensure the project has been properly and thoroughly tested. This document also contains the tools that the team plans on using for testing.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{Software Requirements Specification} lists the functional and non-functional requirements which will aid in testing by formulating a testing plan to meet each requirement. Non-functional requirements should be tested such that the fit criteria are met.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{Hazard Analysis} identifies failure modes to determine the implementation strategies to mitigate them. These will be used as a part of the testing plan to ensure that the failures are covered.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftArchitecture/MG.pdf}{Module Guide} divides the software into modules. The team will build the testing plan around the modules.\\

\noindent The \href{https://github.com/stanreee/sign-language-learning/blob/main/docs/Design/SoftDetailedDes/MIS.pdf}{Module Interface Specification} further decomposes the software's modules into specific access routines. The team will build the testing plan such that each function and routine works as intended.

\section{Functional Requirements Evaluation}

\subsection{System Tests for ASL Learning Progression}

Many of the learning progression tests are redundant, as the development team and some participating users tested multiple ASL signs using the applications `Quiz' and `Practice' sections. All letters of the alphabet were tested to ensure correctness of the system, and all quiz levels were tested to ensure their functionality.

\section{Nonfunctional Requirements Evaluation}

\subsection{System Tests for Usability}

We will be testing our usability requirements using a survey for a group of testers to fill out after using the application for 15 minutes. The group of users will have an interest in learning ASL, and will be willing to fill out this questionnaire to give some perspective on the usability of our application. The list of survey questions and the link to the survey can be found in the Appendix \ref{appen}.

\subsection{Usability Testing Results}

Results from the Usability Survey conducted in partnership with the McMaster Sign Language Club. Participants had a mid to low range of skill levels, aka our target demographic.

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

% \wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
% the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
% the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
% should be highlighted.}
\begin{itemize}

    \item A change due to testing involves ensuring efficiency of sign recognition is held to a high standard from NFRT2 which outlines having a 95\% accuracy of determining the user's hand sign.

    \item From our user testing, we also want to ensure that new and existing users of our application can get the best learning experience possible through a responsive, well designed and tested application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Automated Testing}

Automated testing is taken care of by the automatic linter flake8 upon every push to the repository to ensure that our python code is in line with the styling guide of flake8. We are also using a local and automatic linter eslint for our Javascript code for the front end of our application.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions} \label{appen}

A link to the survey that participants will be given can be found \href{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelcMIJ-egkwLc7gO8MhqO35-FpTtQ6efCKnogOOKVVsrdWNA/viewform}{here}. Participants will be asked to rank how they felt about the following statements, with the response options being Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Please rate your own level of ASL proficiency on a scale of 1-10 \newline [ 1 = I know absolutely nothing, 10 = I sign at a high level]
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence: It was very easy to get right into a testing session with little to no hassle
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence: The User Interface is very friendly and it is easy to identify where everything is
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence: During a Quiz, its very easy to understand what to do and how to complete it
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence: While signing, it is very easy to see what sign I am making and whether to make adjustments or not
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence:  After completing a Quiz,  I receive useful feedback
\item From Strongly Disagree to Strongly Aggree, rate the following sentence: At my current level of ASL knowledge, it is easy to use the application
\item How would you rate your overall experience with ASLingo on a scale of 1-10 \newline [ 1 = Terrible, 10 = Fantastic]
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}

The Verification and Validation (VnV) plan is different than the tests that were actually conducted for the VnV Report in many ways. One main difference was that our team wrote more tests than the tests that were in the original VnV plan, and we also performed even more tests than the ones that were written. This is because when we wrote the VnV plan in November, we only had the proof of concept version of our project completed, so the tests that were written were for an earlier version of the project, or an ideal version of our project. While working on the project for our Rev0 demo, the team was constantly testing both the front and back end to ensure that the required functionality was working according to the specifications lead out in the SRS document. This testing was in line with some of the new test cases that were added to the VnV plan, but many were redundant and are not shown in the final report or plan (such as testing each letter of the alphabet individually multiple times with different people and in different environments) to reduce the length of the report. We think that some of these changes could be anticipated in future projects if a lot more time was given to all the intricacies of what the final project would look and perform like, but some changes to things like the usability of the project you can only really know after doing testing with users and other stakeholders and are harder to predict from a glance.
