\maketitle

This document summarizes the contributions of each team member for the final
demonstration and documentation.  The time period of interest is the time
between Rev 0 and the Final documentation.

\section{Team Meeting Attendance}

%\wss{For each team member how many team meetings have they attended since the
%Rev 0 demo.  This number should be determined from the meeting issues in the
%team's repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of team
%meetings held by the team.  The team meeting attendance should include meetings
%with the team's supervisor, in cases where there is a supervisor.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Meetings}\\
\midrule
Total & 6\\
Cassidy Baldin & 5\\
Stanley Chan & 6\\
Andrew Kil & 6\\
Jeremy Langner & 5\\
Edward Zhuang & 6\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Back-end Team held meetings on our own that Jeremy and Cassidy did not have to attend. 

\section{Lecture Attendance}

%\wss{For each team member how many lectures have they attended since the Rev 0
%demo.  This number should be determined from the lecture issues in the team's
%repo.  The first entry in the table should be the total number of lectures since
%the Rev 0 demo.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Lectures}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Cassidy Baldin & 1\\
Stanley Chan & 1\\
Andrew Kil & 1\\
Jeremy Langner & 1\\
Edward Zhuang & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{TA Document Discussion Attendance}

%\wss{For each team member how many of the informal document discussion meetings
%with the TA were attended since the Rev 0 demo.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Discussions}\\
\midrule
Total & 1\\
Cassidy Baldin & 1\\
Stanley Chan & 1\\
Andrew Kil & 1\\
Jeremy Langner & 1\\
Edward Zhuang & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Commits}

%\wss{For each team member how many commits to the main branch have been made
%since the Rev 0 demo.  The total is the total number of commits for the entire
%team since the Rev 0 demo.  The percentage is the percentage of the total commits
%made by each team member.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Commits} & \textbf{Percent}\\
\midrule
Total & 129 & 100\% \\
Cassidy Baldin & 23 & 18\% \\
Stanley Chan & 76 & 58\% \\
Andrew Kil & 30 & 23\% \\
Jeremy Langner & 17 & 13\% \\
Edward Zhuang & 7 & 6\% \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%\wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.  For
%instance, if a team member has more commits to unmerged branches, these numbers
%can be provided here.}

This data is for the last 30 days on the main branch (Mar 4 to Apr 4) since that was the easiest way to track the metrics for commit history. Final documentation commits are not included here as they are on a separate branch (FinalDoc). Stanley commited a lot since he was working on the dynamic machine learning model and was continuously adding data to the model to ensure it was running properly and had accurate data. Team members also contributed to this data process but it was trained on Stanley's computer so he pushed the changes. 

\section{Issue Tracker}

%\wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
%closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
%issues (C only)). The time period of interest is since the Rev 0 demo.}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Student} & \textbf{Authored (O+C)} & \textbf{Assigned (C only)}\\
\midrule
Total & 52 & 4\\
Cassidy Baldin & 31 & 2\\
Stanley Chan & 9 & 3\\
Andrew Kil & 8 & 1\\
Jeremy Langner & 2 & 2\\
Edward Zhuang & 2 & 1\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The team recently started using the git issue tracker to document issues after it was mentioned in the Rev0 demo by Dr. Smith, before that the team brought up issues with the project through our primary communication tool, Discord. However for better tracability we started using the git issue tracker for the remainder of the project. Cassidy authored many issues as she was the note taker for meetings and lectures.
